/**
 * Reusable Component Classes - Base Styles Only
 * Professional, Code-Based, DRY, KISS, OOP Architecture
 * 
 * Architecture Principles:
 * - DRY: Reusable component classes
 * - KISS: Simple, clear class names
 * - OOP: Component-based organization
 * - SOLID: Single Responsibility - each component does one thing
 * 
 * Note: Specific component styles are in their own files:
 * - Card: src/assets/css/card.css
 * - Button: src/assets/css/components/_button.css
 * - Input: src/assets/css/components/_input.css
 * - Flex/Grid: src/assets/css/core/_utilities.css
 * 
 * Usage:
 * @import '@/assets/css/core/components.css';
